	It’s been over 1000km since I started using the Hyundai Verna Turbo as my long-term car. 
	And so far, I have predominantly used the car in the city. As it turns out, pandemic or not, 
	I have been making quite a few office runs in this period. And, the Mumbai peak hour traffic is almost at its worst already
	 I love that all the new top-spec Hyundai cars now come with wireless charging. <br>
    That means I don’t have to carry a wire or worry about not having charged my phone through the night. <br>
    And it’s a decently quick charger as well.  For starters it’s a comprehensive unit and it will

	The newest member of Volkswagen’s TSI family powers the updated Polo we are driving here. 
	It is the 1.0-litre turbo-petrol unit which is not to be confused with the 1.0-litre MPI motor 
	that was introduced some time back and is still on sale. Where the MPI is good for 75bhp and 95Nm, 
	the new 999cc TSI motor churns out an impressive 109bhp at 5,000rpm and 175Nm

	Think Tata Harrier, and I bet the first thing that comes to your mind is a true-blue SUV with 
	immense road presence that simply loves to flaunt its gorgeous curves.

	Come 2020, and the Tata Harrier is now not just BS6 compliant with about 30bhp more,
	 it also boasts of an automatic gearbox version with additional equipment. 
	 For now, this automatic has got serious competition from the Kia Seltos, Hyundai Creta, and the Jeep Compass.
	  A blacked-out roof can be seen smoothly blending the roof to the tail portion with 
	the signature ‘arrow’ tail lamps that sport snazzy LED internals. <br>
	Be it the towering bonnet armed with piercing DRLs, <br>
